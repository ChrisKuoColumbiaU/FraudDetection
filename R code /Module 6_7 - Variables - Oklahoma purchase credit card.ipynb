    "### Oklahoma purchase credit card transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Office of Management and Enterprise Services in the State of Oklahoma has made its [purchase credit card transactions](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/purchase-card-pcard-fiscal-year-2014) available. This dataset contains information on purchases made through the purchase card programs administered by the state and higher education institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare the dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "When you model, you will ask youself the goal of the modeling purpose. Our purpose is to detect suspicious behaviors for an individual agency for a particular merchant category. We therefore propose two ways to organize the modeling datasets:\n",
    "1. Each row in the modeling dataset is a record of an agency name. \n",
    "2. Each row in the modeling dataset is a record of a merchant category of an agency name. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset is (1), the variables shall detail the statistics for each merchant category. For example, the variables can be \"Merchant1_1wk_dol\" to \"Merchant100_1wk_dol\" for the dollar amount in 1 week for Merchant Category 1 to 100. Similarly, other merchant-category variables such as XX weeks or number of transactions can be created.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset is (2), the variables can be the Recency-Frequency_Monetary (RFM) variables for each merchant category of an agency name. In the following program, we will proceed with (2). You are encouraged to test (1) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some considerations on the variables:\n",
    "Obviously the spending amounts will vary widely by agency name and merchant category. In many unsupervised methods such as cluster analysis, data points of similar magnitudes tend to be clustered together. For example, the following table shows the average amounts for Agency A and B for their merchant categories. A cluster analysis may group Record 1, 2, 3 together, and leave Record 4 alone. Is this result reasonable?    \n",

    "You will prepare the modeling dataset for DBSCAN clustering. You are also encouraged to perform K-means to compare the results. The outliers will be identified by DBSCAN. Then you will use the principal component technique to reduce the features. The principal component is used only to visualize the results. "
