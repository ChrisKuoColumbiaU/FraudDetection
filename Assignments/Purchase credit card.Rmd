```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown
The dataset comes from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/purchase-card-pcard-fiscal-year-2014

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

```{}
pcard<-read_csv("/Users/chriskuo/downloads/purchase_credit_card.csv", col_types = cols())
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
