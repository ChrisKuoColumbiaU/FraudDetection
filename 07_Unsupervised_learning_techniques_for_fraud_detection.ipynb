    "Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning algorithm to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labelled responses. Different from supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms deal with data that have no explicit labelled responses or target outputs. It may seem somewhat mysterious to imagine what the machine could possibly learn because there is no feedback from its environment. However, it is possible to develop a formal framework based on the notion that the machine’s goal is to find the relationships among the data, or build representations of the input data. In other words, unsupervised learning can be thought of as finding patterns in the data for decision-making or predicting future inputs.\n",

The second person cuts the rest $ 1−p$ of fishes with an average length of $\\mu_2$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_2$. Assume the length follows a normal distribution.

If this is represented in a hidden Markov model terminology, the invisible state is the fish worker and the observable outcome is the fish length. The outcome is the sum of the two distributions from the two hidden states. Because there is a finite number of states, hidden markov models are also called *finite-state HMM*.

    "##### Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) \n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN can handle clusters of various shapes and sizes. DBSCAN is able to find clusters that K-mean would not be able to find. Since its invention by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996, it has been gaining increasing popularity. DBSCAN is resistant to noise, \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a density-based clustering algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away). The figure below illustrates the idea. It groups together points in high-density (the colored dots) and marks as outliers (the white dots) for those that lie alone in low-density regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"DBSCAN.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike K-means, DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters. The algorithm lies in two measures. The first one is $\\epsilon$-Neighborhood: all points with a radius of $\\epsilon$ from point $q$. The second one is MinPts: minimum number of points in the given neighborhood. See Figure A. If a point has many points in its $\\epsilon$-radius, the density in that radius is high. Thus the name *density-based* comes from. Each point can be a *core* point if it its density is high, or a *border* point if its density is low but still in the neighborhood of a core point, or a $noise$ point that is not a core nor a border point. See Figure B.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"DBSCAN_combo.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN can cluster points by reaching out in any direction as long as a another point $p$ is in $q$'s $\\epsilon$-neighborhood or *directly density-reachable* from $q$. The following figure shows how DBSCAN grows its clusters. $p_1$ is directly density-reachable from $q$, $p_2$ is directly density-reachable from $p_1$, and so on until all $q, p_1, p_2, p$ are clustered together. Thus it can develop clusters of arbitrary shape in spatial databases with noise. \n",

    "##### MeanShift\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MeanShift is an intuitive, powerful non-parametric algorithm. It was invented long back in 1975 by Fukunaga and Hostetler but did not gain its popularity unill two papers applied the algorithm to Computer Vision. Inn contrast to the K-means clustering algorithm, the output of mean shift does not depend on any explicit assumptions on the shape of the point distribution, the number of clusters, or any form of random initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Comaniciu](http://comaniciu.net/Papers/MsRobustApproach.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"MeanShift.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it work? Mean shift first finds the centroid of a set of data points. Secondly it shifts the center of window towards the mean until it converges - thus the name *meanshift*. The algorithm iteratively assign each data point towards the closest cluster centroid. The figure below shows the process of the convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Meanshift process all.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean shift algorithm assumes that all points are sampled from some underlying probability density function (p.d.f.), with regions of high sample density corresponding to the local maxima of the distribution. This centroid-based approach computes the centroids of various regions in the dataset. Finally the algorithm settles with a few centroids the final clusters. How do we use Mean Shift for outlier dection? As in DBSCAN, data points far from the centroids can be ignored by the clustering process and thus flagged as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of visual presentation we generate 2-feature data points in the following example. Readers are encouraged to generate data with higher dimensions. We use make_blobs of sklearn.datasets. The default values are:\n",
    "sklearn.datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=100, n_features=2, centers=3, cluster_std=1.0, center_box=(-10.0, 10.0), shuffle=True, random_state=None). Make_blobs returns X, an array of shape [n_samples, n_features] and y, the integer labels for cluster membership of each sample."
