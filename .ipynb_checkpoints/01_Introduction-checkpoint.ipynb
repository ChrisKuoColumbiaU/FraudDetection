    "## The growth of fraud risks\n",
    "\n",
    "As the old proverb says, “A thief is a thief, whether he steals a diamond or a cucumber.” The  fast-developing digital world also come with growing fraud. Fraud rises and no industry is immune. From healthcare to insurance to companies with highly valuable intellectual properties. Fraud schemes also become more and more sophisticated that legacy detection cannot keep up with. The fraudsters have grown their ability to detect the weak links in systems by using distributed networks, big data and the dark web to find the weak links to maximise their monetary gains. Also, access to faster and cheaper cloud computing empowers fraudsters larger scale of attacks. Companies can suffer devastating losses almost overnight.\n",

    "Fraud is increasing at an alarming rate. The Federal Trade Commission released the Annual Summary of Consumer Compliants that [Identity theft](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/03/ftc-releases-annual-summary-consumer-complaints) is the top third complaints. In insurance, the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud named the eight worst insurance criminals of 2016 in its [Hall of shame](http://www.insurancefraud.org/hall-of-shame.htm). J.P.Morgan in its [2017 Payments Fraud and Control Survey](https://commercial.jpmorganchase.com/jpmpdf/1320732417358.pdf) \n",
    "reports 75 percent of organizations experienced check fraud in 2016. Mobile fraud becomes a rampant issue too. The complexity of the mobile devices allow scammers to hide in the systems. J.P.Morgan reports that over 70 percent of corporate treasury and finance professionals seriouly concern adopting mobile payments at their organizations.\n",

    "## Finding fraud fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission is simple but also hard: finding fraud fast. Financial companies, e-commerce and others are targeted by fraudsters and organised crime rings. Fraudsters use a wide array of tactics to alter, omit or falsify data and gain access to unauthorised funds. To reduce and prevent future loss, companies must detect fraud as soon as possible. Effective fraud prevention relies on fast data curation, better alerting and response before a payment is made. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In U.S. banking electronic payments are settled by banks the following day, a relatively slow compared to systems in other countries. But this is not the case anymore. Same Day ACH (Automated Clearing House) settles payments on the same day. Same Day ACH presents great exposuress  in the risk of fraud. Faster payments will open doors for fraudsters, so companies have shorter time to react to incidents of fraud.\n",

    "## Machine learning for fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "As fraudsters advance in technology and scale, we need more machine learning techniques to detect earlier and more accurately. Machine learning offers a combination of predictive and behavioural analytics as well as social network analysis to uncover suspicious patterns to improve detection accuracy. The benefits of machine learning include:\n",
    "* Making decisions in-time: Sophisticated analytics should also be built to provide speed and eases business decisions. \n",
    "* Finding new patterns: Machine learning techniques can uncover new patterns to detect changes in fraud behaviours\n",
    "* Less disruption to regular claims: Genuine claims need to be honored and fraudulent claims need to be deterred. Machine learning aims at lower falst positive rate to yield less interruption to regular claims.\n",
    "* Reducing opperation cost: a reduction of the payout on fraudulent claims will increase the opperation efficiency.\n",

    "## Why this book?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many books on machine learning and artificial intelligence for Ph.D. students in computer science with advanced mathematics. While turning practical problems into elegant mathematical solutions, there is a need for the new data scientists to survey the wide range of fraudulent bahaviors and consequences. On the other hand, fraud detection practitioners need a suite of new machine learning techniques to fight against fraud effectively. In this book we attempt to cover the best practices in fraud detection, as well as the cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The author draws examples from insurance, financial services and retail industries since he has served in these industries for 17+ years. We hope this book will help data scientists, fraud detection analysts and practitioners at special investigation units (SIU) in fighting fraud and achieve efficiency.\n",

    "## The features of the book\n",
    "This book is about the uses of machine learning techniques in fraud detection. There are many journal papers in data anomaly and fraud detection, but relatively few that feature all the different aspects covered in this book. This book discusses the trajectory from machine learning to insight to decision. Each chapter is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the machine learning concept, followed by code examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Journal research\n",
    "This book presents what research has been done in fraud detection. Research projects range from healthcare, credit card, insurance, payments and operation. Therefore this book enables readers to apply the approach to address similar type of problems. This book also includes datasets from Kaggle competitions and public domains for readers to test. The use case \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code examples\n",
    "This book shows the readers the basic building blocks in Python and R for the selected machine learning techniques. By learning the code examples, you will be hands-on with the step-by-step actions the code takes to complete the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use cases \n",
    "At the end of each major session this book challenges the data scientists with the write-up of a use case for fraud detection. Use cases are about capturing what the benefits of the technique, what it can do, and how it is implemented. In software development a use case is the requirements for the system to deliver the value. Use cases are simply a different method for organizing functional requirements. The goal of creating use cases is to transform the promised outcomes into procedures, steps and observable measures. One of the most common challenge to data scientists is that the use cases either contain too much detail or not enough. A use case that does not include enough detail tends to be more like an elevator speech. On the other hand, a use cases that includes too much technical detail tend to be more like system design documentation. We will following a list of questions for the requirements by [bridging-the-gap](http://www.bridging-the-gap.com/what-questions-do-i-ask-during-requirements-elicitation/) to develop the user cases.\n",

    "## The structure of the book\n",
    "This book aims to equip you to:\n",
    "* Identify potential applications of machine learning in fraud detection.\n",
    "* Describe the core differences in machine learning techniques.\n",
    "* Represent your data in feature engineering to yield a better outcome.\n",
    "* Assess the model quality with the appropriate error metrics.\n",
    "* Implement these techniques in Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chapter 1 explains the motives of this book and why we choose this particular layout.\n",
    "* Chapter 2 \n",
    "* Chapter 3 walks the readers through feature engineering. \n",
    "* Chapter 4 shows how to create features from textual data.\n",
    "* Chapter 5 explains the need to handle extremely imbalanced data in supervised learning, and introduces several sampling techniques.\n",
    "* Chapter 6 covers supervised learning techniques in fraud detection.\n",
    "* Chapter 7 covers unsupervised learning techniques.\n",
    "* Chapter 8 explains how to use graph-based techniques to detect fraud."
