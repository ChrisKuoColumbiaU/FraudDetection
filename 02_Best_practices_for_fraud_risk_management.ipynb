    "## What is fraud?\n",
    "According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, fraud is \"intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value.\" In legal dictionary, fraud is \"when a person deliberately practices deception in order to gain something unlawfully or unfairly.\" In most states, the act of fraud can be classified as either a civil or a criminal wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud can be either hard fraud or soft fraud. <b>Hard fraud</b> occurs when someone deliberately plans a loss, such as an auto collision, auto theft, or house fire in order to claim payment for damages. Criminal rings are sometimes involved in hard fraud schemes. <b>Soft fraud</b> is far more common than hard fraud. Soft fraud is systematic abuse. For example, in an auto collision claim a claimant may claim more damage than actually occured. In a medical insurance claim an individual or an physician may exaggerate existing conditions that require overtreatment or result in the abuse of medical resources.\n",

    "## Why does fraud occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deter fraud, it will be helpful to understand how and why people commit fraud. \n",
    "Knowing the “how” and \"why\" helps managers and business owners create policies and design internal controls to reduce the occurrence of fraud. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fraud_triangle.jpg\" align = \"right\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three conditions that cause fraud to occus: <b>motivation</b>, <b>opportunity</b>, and <b>rationalization</b>. Suppose there is an altruistic physician with a patient who is unable to meet the payment for a required treatment. The \"pressure\" may be that the ultra-benevolent physian feels compassion to cover the bill. The \"opportunity\" can be that the physician covers the expense by submitting false claims. And the \"rationalization\" is the doctor feels justified by helping the patient. However, it is still a fraud. Likewise, suppose an employee is in charge of vendor selection. The \"pressure\" may be that the employee living beyond the means and facing a personal financial crisis. The \"opportunity\" is the employees having access to assets and information that allows them to both commit and conceal fraud. Th employee sets up a phantom vendor account and creates false invoices to collect payments to him. The employee may \"rationalize\" his action by thinking he would return the funds in a later time, or he has been conributing greatly to the company, etc.\n",

    "## An effective anti-fraud strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Many organisations are building formal systems and procedures in place to prevent, detect and respond to fraud. [Kroll](https://www.kroll.com/en-us/default.aspx) suveyed 1,265 executives worldwide and [reports](https://www.kroll.com/CMSPages/GetAzureFile.aspx?path=~%5Cmedia%5Cfiles%5Cintelligence-center%5Cglobal-fraud-report-2013-2014-english.pdf&hash=a84e800f9068acd3e3ce664e95666772c22ccf4547183e750ecf984b2041343d) that “All businesses are confronted with the risk of fraud. How they respond – the nature of their approach to prevention, detection, investigation and disclosure will separate those who manage through the issues from those who suffer significant loss.” An effective anti-fraud strategy has four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prevention\n",
    "One way to deal with fraud is to adopt methods that\n",
    "will decrease motive, restrict opportunity and limit\n",
    "the ability for potential fraudsters to rationalise\n",
    "their actions. The aim of preventative controls is to\n",
    "reduce opportunity and remove temptation from \n",
    "potential offenders. Prevention techniques include\n",
    "the introduction of policies, procedures and controls\n",
    "as well as activities such as training and fraud\n",
    "awareness to stop fraud from occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/article/preventing-healthcare-fraud-with-big-data-and-analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection\n",
    "A fraud detection strategy should involve use of analytical and other procedures to highlight\n",
    "anomalies, and the introduction of reporting mechanisms that provide for communication\n",
    "of suspected fraudulent acts. Key elements of a comprehensive fraud detection system would\n",
    "include: Exception reporting, Data mining, Trend analysis, Ongoing risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response\n",
    "The Plan defines authority levels, responsibilities for action, and reporting lines in the event of a\n",
    "suspected fraud or irregularity. It acts as a checklist of actions and a guide to follow in the event\n",
    "of fraud being suspected. The Plan is designed to enable Company to:\n",
    "(i) prevent further loss;\n",
    "(ii) establish and secure evidence necessary for criminal, civil and/or disciplinary action;\n",
    "(iii) determine when to contact the police and establish lines of communication;\n",
    "(iv) assign responsibility for investigating the incident;\n",
    "(v) minimize and recover losses;\n",
    "(vi) review the reasons for the incident, the measures taken to prevent a recurrence, and\n",
    "determine any action needed to strengthen future responses to fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterrance\n",
    "Deterrence involves eliminating factors that may cause fraud, whereas prevention involves identifying and stopping existing fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud deterrence is based on the premise that fraud is not a random occurrence; fraud occurs where the conditions are right for it to occur. Fraud deterrence attacks the root causes and enablers of fraud; this analysis could reveal potential fraud opportunities in the process, but is performed on the premise that improving organizational procedures to reduce or eliminate the causal factors of fraud is the single best defense against fraud. Fraud deterrence involves both short term (procedural) and long term (cultural) initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud deterrence is not earlier fraud detection, and this is often a confusing point. Fraud detection involves a review of historical transactions to identify indicators of a non-conforming transaction. Deterrence involves an analysis of the conditions and procedures that affect fraud enablers, in essence, looking at what could happen in the future given the process definitions in place, and the people operating that process. Deterrence is a preventive measure – reducing input factors” (Cendrowski, Martin, Petro, The Handbook of Fraud Deterrence).\n",

    "## Steps to create your fraud program\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Identify all the areas where fraud is expected to occur and the possible types of fraud.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Measure the risk of fraud and the overall exposure to the organization. Prioritize the risks based on fraud.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Apply machine learning in detecting frauds early.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Establish risk assessment and decide where to pay closer attention.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Monitor the activity with dashboard and data visualization. Communicate it throughout the organization so that employees in the organization are aware about the happening in the organization.</li>\n",
    "  <li>If there is any fraud found out, inform the management immediately to solve out the issue and to find out why it happened.</li>\n",
