    "Figure (A) shows an example of fraud ring. This ring includes five people, a doctor, and a lawyer. The drivers and passengers stage accidents, whose roles can be recycled (they call it recycling the roles\"), so a driver in an accident can be a witness in another accident. The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) reports these staged crimes are [big business](https://www.nicb.org/prevent-fraud-theft/staged-auto-accident-fraud). The state of Florida, a no-fault state, is notorious for its rising auto accident frauds though it has been controlled in resent years. Under the no-fault laws, a driver is required to have Personal Injury Protection (PIP) to cover his own injury in an accident. The driver will recover financial losses from his own insurance company up to a specified threshold. The fraud ring thus stages a hit-and-run car accident. The fake passenage can file a claim and get paid by his insurance company. Florida enacted the No-Fault Reform or the Anti-Fraud Laws in 2012 to impose heavy penalties on medical providers who commit PIP fraud. It is [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/floridas-no-fault-reform-anti-fraud-laws-are-working-300017990.html) the number and cost of Personal Injury Protection (PIP) insurance claims have been reduced since then. However, it is anticipated new innovation in fraud ring will emerge in different forms, so the methods and technologies to catch fraud will be needed.\n",

    "[Auto repair scam](https://www.nicb.org/prevent-fraud-theft/avoid-auto-repair-scams). \n",
    "What happens is an unscrupulous auto shop can use cheap airbags (previously deployed and salvaged) to replace a customer’s deployed airbag, and then bill your insurance company for the retail value of a new one. In this staged case the insurance company should see suspicious number of airbag replacement by a particular auto shop.\n",

    "### Fraud ring example 2: First-party fraud in retail banking\n",
    "\n",
    "First-party fraud (FPF) is defined as when someone enters into a relationship with a bank <b>using either their own identity or a synthetic identity</b> with the intent to defraud. It is different from third-party fraud (also known as “identity fraud”) in which a third person's identification is used. According to the U.S. federal government, charge-off rates are currently at about 10% of all outstanding consumer credit. Most estimates of the amount of charged-off credit attributed to first-party fraud range [from 10% to 25%](http://www.infoglide.com/blog/first-party-fraud-assessing-the-damage/). In other words, a bank loses up to 25 cents of every dollar in receivables to FPF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fraudsters create <b>synthetic identities</b>, which is usually a mix of real identity and fictitious identity. How do they do that? Take a look of the following steps:\n",
    "* SSN: Get a Social Security Number (SSN) of another person\n",
    "* Name: Fabricate a name to be used with the SSN. \n",
    "* Birth date: Create false birth dates that match the appearance of the fraudster, in case in-person appearances are required.\n",
    "* Address: Create an address to receive mail fraudulently\n",
    "* Phone: Provide telephone numbers\n",
    "* Apply a credit account (important): It will be declined in the first application by the credit reporting agencies (CRAs) or credit bureaus. However, after that the fake name with that SSN is in CRAs' systems. Submit the application again until it is accepted.\n",
    "* Add an authorized user (most popular): it is legitimate for a card to add authorized users such as a spouse or a child. Fraudsters exploit the process by piggybacking they names.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/busted out fraud.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not here to discuss various ways to bypass the security system. Readers are encouraged to see other ways to [creat synthetic identities](https://securityintelligence.com/synthetic-identity-theft-three-ways-synthetic-identities-are-created/). Once the identities are created, fraudsters typically build up a good history of behavior with timely payments and low utilizations. They act \"normally\" -- shopping regularly, opening accounts at different organizations and checking their credit scores. They made overpayment in the final stage of the bust out. That's why FPF is also called the Busted-out fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/FPF.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because synthetic identities are generated by recycling personal identitifiable information (PII), it is likely the same PII appear multiple times. In the Figure there are five fabricated card holders. It maybe perfectly normal that two card holders sharing the same phone number or address. However, it is highly unlikely two card holders sharing the same SSN. By examining the relationships of the cardholders in the huge database, there is a high chance to detect this fraud ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the \"traditional\" anomaly dection techniques cannot catch them?\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapter we illustrate anomaly detecion techniques with an example on credit card transactions. There are two reasons why the anomaly detection techniques do not work here. The first one lies in the fact that <b>fraudster's behaviors look normal</b>. These fraudsters hide themselves in the normal behaviors, so it is very hard to detect them at the individual card level. The second reason is <b>ineffective detecting technique</b>. We create features by a single dimension such as transaction time, location, payment type, etc. to determine the anomaly. However, it becomes ineffective when we need to detect if someone is using a stolen identity, syntehtic identify, fake IP address or a hijacked device. In order to catch the relationships among the targets, we need to examine the connectivity among the account holders or claims."

The synthetic identities come from any combination of the 5 elements (name, SSN, ZIP+4 and phone number) from the 4 records. As a result, there are $ 4^5=256$ synthetic identities.

The LOAD CSV statement also supports common options, such as accessing via column header or column index, configuring the terminator character and other common options.
