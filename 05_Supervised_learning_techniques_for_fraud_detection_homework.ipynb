    "I prefer the package 'dismo' that was mentioned by Abbas. It (dismo::gbm.step()) does a stepwise training of the GBM model based on automatical cross-validation, and then you can drop all the predictors that seems to be unimportant with the dismo::gbm.simplify() function. All these automatical features can be parameterized by changing the default arguments of the functions, therefore you won't lose control over your model... I attached some papers about the dismo-version GBM/BRT (Boosted Regression Trees) and its advantages that you might find interesting. FYI I also attached one of my research papers in which we used package dismo for modeling natural habitats with GBM.\n"
